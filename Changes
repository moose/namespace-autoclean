Revision history for {{$dist->name}}

  - Add -except to import options. This allows you to explicitly not clean a
    sub. (Dave Rolsky)
  - Changed the code to no longer _require_ Class::MOP. If your class is not a
    Moose class then we don't load Class::MOP. This was particularly
    problematic for Moo classes. Using namespace::autoclean with a Moo class
    "upgraded" it to be a Moose class. (Dave Rolsky)
  - Using this module just broke overloading in a class. Reported by Chris
    Weyl. (RT#50938)
